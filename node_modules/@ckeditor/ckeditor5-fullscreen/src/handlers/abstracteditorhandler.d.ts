/**
 * The abstract editor type handler.
 *
 * This class defines some actions and behaviors that are applied when fullscreen mode is toggled, and which are common
 * regardless of the editor type. Then, specific classes like `ClassicEditorHandler` or `DecoupledEditorHandler`
 * extend this class with actions specific for these editor types.
 *
 * Extend this class to provide fullscreen mode handling for unsupported editor types,
 * or if you wish to heavily customize the default behavior.
 *
 * The only method that is necessary to provide when extending this class is {@link #defaultOnEnter}. However, make sure to
 * familiarize yourself with the below full list of actions taken by `FullscreenAbstractEditorHandler` to understand
 * what is covered by default, and what should be provided by you.
 *
 * When entering the fullscreen mode, the {@link #enable} method is called. It creates the properly styled container
 * and handles the editor features that need it, in the following order:
 *
 * 1. Saves the scroll positions of all ancestors of the editable element to restore them after leaving the fullscreen mode.
 * 2. Executes the {@link #defaultOnEnter} method to move the proper editor UI elements to the fullscreen mode.
 * **If you extend the abstract handler, you should override this method** to move the elements that are specific to your editor type, like:
 * 	editable, toolbar, menu bar.
 * 	Use {@link #moveToFullscreen} method for this purpose to ensure they are automatically cleaned up after leaving the fullscreen mode.
 * 3. Adds proper classes to the `<body>` and `<html>` elements to block page scrolling, adjust `z-index` etc.
 *
 * Steps 4-12 are only executed if the corresponding features are used.
 *
 * 4. If presence list is used, moves it to the fullscreen mode container.
 * 5. If document outline is used, moves it to the fullscreen mode.
 * 6. If pagination is used, adjusts it's configuration for the changed view.
 * 7. If annotations are used, moves them to the fullscreen mode.
 * 8. If revision history is used, overrides the callbacks to show the revision viewer in the fullscreen mode.
 * 9. If AI Tabs is used, moves it to the fullscreen mode.
 * 10. If source editing and document outline are both used, registers a callback hiding the document outline header in source editing mode.
 * 11. Changes the position of some dialogs to utilize the empty space on the right side of the editable element.
 * 12. If custom container is used, hides all other elements in it to ensure they don't create an empty unscrollable space.
 *
 * Then finally:
 *
 * 13. Adjusts the visibility of the left and right sidebars based on the available space.
 * 14. Sets up a resize observer to adjust the visibility of the left and right sidebars dynamically.
 * 15. Executes the configured {@link module:fullscreen/fullscreenconfig~FullscreenConfig#onEnterCallback
 * 	`config.fullscreen.onEnterCallback`} function.
 * 	By default, it returns the fullscreen mode container element so it can be further customized.
 *
 * When leaving the fullscreen mode, the {@link #disable} method is called. It does the following:
 *
 * 1. Execute the configured {@link module:fullscreen/fullscreenconfig~FullscreenConfig#onLeaveCallback
 * 	`config.fullscreen.onLeaveCallback`} function.
 * 2. Remove the classes added to the `<body>` and `<html>` elements.
 * 3. If document outline is used, restore its default container.
 * 4. If annotations are used, restore their original state (UI, filters etc).
 * 5. If revision history is used, restore the original callbacks.
 * 7. If AI Tabs is used, restore it to the original state.
 * 8. If source editing and document outline are both used, restore the document outline header.
 * 9. Restore all moved elements to their original place.
 * 10. Destroy the fullscreen mode container.
 * 11. If the editor has a toolbar, switch its behavior to the one configured in the
 * 	{@link module:ui/toolbar/toolbarview~ToolbarOptions#shouldGroupWhenFull} property.
 * 12. Restore the scroll positions of all ancestors of the editable element.
 * 13. If pagination is used, restore its default configuration.
 * 14. Restore default dialogs positions.
 *
 * This class is exported to allow for custom extensions.
